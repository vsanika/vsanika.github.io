            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I'm currently pursuing a Master of Information Systems Management at Carnegie Mellon University, with a planned graduation date in May 2023.
<br>
Previously, I worked with the data analytics team of Deloitte India's forensic services financial advisory group for almost four years. During my time there, I provided ad-hoc analysis to cross-functional teams to identify fraud trends in forensic audits and gained strong client-side exposure with government regulatory bodies. I also worked independently on end-to-end data analytics and process improvement, as well as process mining for a large consumer goods firm with teams located across multiple continents. I have also led a small team of data analysts for some large-scale data analytics projects.
<br>
At CMU, my coursework has focused on data-oriented subjects such as data science, big data, and machine learning. My primary skill sets lie in data analysis and visualization using SQL, Python, Tableau, advanced Excel, and hands-on implementation of machine learning models through assignments and projects.
<br>
I'm actively looking for full-time opportunities in data analytics and related fields after my graduation.</p>
